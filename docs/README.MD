## Advanced initialization
### Initialization point
Currently, you can initialize Adapty SDK using `activateAdapty` function. It is better to place it in a core component, such as `App.js`, for several reasons:
* You want to make sure, that function was mounted before you've used any other Adapty method, otherwise methods would throw an error
* You want to make sure, that your app won't unload initialization from memory, as it can be used to log notifications

### Possible arguments
`activateAdapty` function takes an `AdaptyActivateProps` object as an argument. It has these possible keys:
<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Key</b></td>
<td><b>Obligatory</b></td>
<td><b>Type</b></td>
<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sdkKey</td>
<td>YES</td>
<td>string</td>
<td>Your public Adapty SDK key</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>customerUserId</td>
<td>NO</td>
<td>string | undefined</td>
<td>Any value to identify user. Makes it easier to find this user in Adapty Dashboard. Provide alongside authorization if possible. Otherwise, you can use user.identify() method. Default is <i>undefined</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>observerMode</td>
<td>NO</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>In some cases, if you have already built a functioning subscription system, it may not be possible or feasible to use the Adapty SDK to make purchases. However, you can still use the SDK to get access to the data. Default is <i>false</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>logLevel</td>
<td>NO</td>
<td>'verbose' | 'errors' | 'none'</td>
<td>You can enable logs to debug methods you use. Currently logs are displayed in XCode only. Default is <i>'none'</i></td>
</tr>
</tr>
</table>

### Initialization Example
```ts
import { activateAdapty } from 'react-native-adapty';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  ...
  useEffect(() => {
    activateAdapty({
      sdkKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_SDK_KEY",
      customerUserId: store.user.id,
      observerMode: true,
      logLevel: "verbose",
    });
  },[]);
  ...
}
```

## User methods
### Identifying user after initialization with `adapty.user.identify`
> iOS: ðŸ‘Œ, Android ðŸ‘Œ

If you don't know any ID of your user, for example, if your user hasn't authorized yet, you can set `customerUserId` after SDK has initialized. To do so you can use `adapty.user.identify( userId: string )` method.

```ts
adapty.user.identify(user.id);
```

### Collecting information about user with `adapty.user.updateProfile`
> iOS: ðŸ‘Œ, Android ðŸ‘Œ

You can add optional information to your user, such as email, phone number, etc. or update it with analytics ids to make tracking even more precise.

```ts
adapty.user.updateProfile({ firstName, email });
```

### Disassociating device with current user with `adapty.user.logout`
> iOS: ðŸ‘Œ, Android ðŸ‘Œ

Disconnects a device from a current adapty customerId. Should be called on logging out.

```ts
adapty.user.logout();
```

## Purchases methods
### Acquiring user purchases status with `adapty.purchases.getInfo`
> iOS: ðŸ‘Œ, Android ðŸ‘Œ

If your user obtains any product or subscription, you can easily get such information:

```ts
const info = await adapty.purchases.getInfo();

// For example, check if user has active subscription
const isUserSubscribed = info.paidAccessLevels?.level_configured_in_dashboard?.isActive;
```

### Making Purchases with `adapty.purchases.makePurchase`
> iOS: ðŸ‘Œ, Android ðŸ‘Œ
In order for this to work, please, make sure you have filled Apple Connect products into Adapty Dashboard

You can perform native purchases and log them to your Adapty dashboard in one action. This function will return a receipt and a product user has purchased on completion.

```ts
const purchase = await adapty.purchases.makePurchase('500_coins');
```

### Restoring unresolved purchases with `adapty.purchases.restore`
> iOS: ðŸ‘Œ, Android ðŸ‘Œ

You can restore user's purchases using `restore`. If it succeeds, you will be able to find user's products with `adapty.purchases.getInfo` 

```ts
adapty.purchases.restore();
```

### Validating receipts with `adapty.purchases.validate`
> iOS: ðŸ‘Œ, Android ðŸ‘Œ

You can easily validate receipts with Adapty SDK:

```ts
adapty.purchases.restore();
```

## Promo methods
### Getting available promos with `adapty.promo.getPromo`
> iOS: ðŸ‘Œ, Android ðŸ‘Œ

You can get available promotional offers available to user with

```ts
adapty.promo.getPromo();
```

## Paywall methods
> We are currently working on enhancing a proccess of displaying paywalls, stay tuned!

### Collecting all paywalls with `adapty.paywalls.getPaywalls`
> iOS: ðŸ‘Œ, Android ðŸ‘Œ

You can manually get a list of available paywalls and products:

```ts
adapty.paywalls.getPaywalls();
```
